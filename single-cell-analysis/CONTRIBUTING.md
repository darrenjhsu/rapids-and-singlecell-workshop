# Contributing to Clara Parabricks Single Cell Analysis Blueprint
Contributions to this single-cell analysis blueprint will fall into the following 2 categories.

## 1. Find bugs in existing notebooks or launchable:

If an something breaks or doesn't run in the notebook [file an issue](https://github.com/clara-parabricks-workflows/single-cell-analysis-blueprint/issues/new) describing what you encountered or what you want to see changed and the Clara Parabricks team will evaluate the issues and triage them. 

If you believe the issue needs priority attention, please comment on the issue to notify the team. 

## 2. Proposing a new notebook:

We recommend proposing all new notebooks to scverse's [RAPIDS-singlecell notebooks](https://rapids-singlecell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and support their great work!

If you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications.
